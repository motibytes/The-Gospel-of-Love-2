The Gospel of Love 2 

# About the Author 

'Long ago', the author wrote [The Gospel of Love](https://github.com/motibytes/The-Gospel-of-Love), an artistic reinterpretation of selected scripture from the Gospel of Matthew. 
Readers had no reference point with which to draw the force in question. 
This reveals that perhaps the words of Christ should not be modified as the teaching becomes more abstract rather than less. Alas! Here we are.

What I hear in the darkness, I speak in the light, 
what I hear in my ear, I express! 


# About this Work 

This work is as it is. This work may be copied but this line should be intact redirecting to the original source material at [The Gospel of Love 2](https://github.com/motibytes/The-Gospel-of-Love-2).

This work significantly adds to the words of Christ and the Gospel of Matthew and portrays a fundamentally different portrait of the philosophy of the Christ than what is taught in Christology. 
The author is unsure of any eternal consequences for putting words into the mouth of Christ. 

This interpretation is how the author envisions the hidden understanding of the poets and lovers. 

This work should be considered, at worst, as containing abstract spiritual principles and targets the scriptures the church avoids and does not often teach on. 

This work should be considered, at best, an expression of art and love, 
and as food for spiritual contemplation. 

This work adds 'futurism' 'technology' flair to all parables! 

# Preface - The Subject in Question 

This force which must be experienced, this is a force on the other side of the veil of reality.
It is underneath the illusion and is seen when the illusion breaks. 
The disconnection and isolation you feel between yourself and others around you is the illusion you are within. 

One can only be shown love by another. The author believes that, not unlike the princess stories for children, 
only an act of true love can break the sleeping spell. This act is an act of kindness that warms a heart of stone 
so strikingly that the illusion can no longer remain, a sword is cut into the fabric of reality and the underlying 
substance, underneath that fabric, rushes in to fill the space. 

The author's experience is, the act in question is more likely to be effective if it demonstrates that which is truly 
absurd for another being to offer, that which strikingly puts the giver of a gift in a place of vulnerability, 
especially by means of breaking social barriers and risking embarrassment. 
This is to say, to put one's heart out there in a way that no ordinary person would, for no selfish reason. 

This is similar to the way we share romantic love, in which we offer our hearts to one another, 
risking rejection in order to connect. This romantic love however, while it may demonstrate *a love*, 
the intentions behind it, which is akin to a bargain that fulfills needs of both parties, this is not the 
true love that breaks the sleeping spell. 

The love shared in family and friendship in the author's opinion is also not the true love that breaks the sleeping spell.

The elusive true love's kiss, in the author's experience, is the act of loving kindness that has no deeper motivation or 
agenda behind it, it is not dependent even on if the subject is one the giver fancies or not. That is, the act has nothing 
to do with the subject's person or the giver's person, it is an act of true love for it is an act to Love, for Love. Blessed are we when we receive a love from another when our person seemingly had no qualification to deserve it! 

The author usually uses this example at this time to express the kind of love being discussed. The author's perspective 
is that if the "given" recognizes the act, then the vision of both parties is opened and they are both able to experience 
the force that is there and not dependent on either of them, from an artistic viewpoint, the eyes of one has seen the eyes of 
the other and this has caused a portal to become opened. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, the eye must be opened to this beauty. 

The giver may have already been able to 'see' love at the time of the act or not, it does not matter, it is the 
choices that cause this event, not the current 'wakefulness' of the giver. 

This is not to say that the way of love is to go do selfless acts for others, even if that were true. This is only to provide
context to the force being discussed, this example is used because the reader usually has encountered an experience that closely 
matches the above encounter in their lifetime.  

The model painted here is actually that we would all be experiencing this force at all times if we were not casting our own veil of ignorance 
over ourselves in order to defend ourselves from the threat of pain, that it is we who choose to believe we are alone in order to not risk the 
vulnerability of getting hurt in connection by a temporary rejection of other. 

The concept, "there is no power to hurt" means that the real you cannot be rejected nor hurt, that when someone hurts you, so to say 
you are bearing witness to two characters that cannot currently see that they are not what they imagine themselves to be. 
This would mean that the actual place you reside in is within the place of this force being discussed. While this goes beyond the 
scope of this introduction it adds to the model. 

In summary, this force can only be experienced and is easily seen when an act is demonstrated that shows the receiver that another 
being sees their humanity and cares for them, this seems to be an act that looks past the fictional self the receiver believed they were, 
and allows them to see that the target of the gift is their underlying being, the human worthy of love in their very existence, 
that is to say, the being that has fundamental human rights and value. 

# Love's Blessing

Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Love. 

# Love's Draw 

Draw near to Love and Love will draw near to you! 

# Love's Draw 

“Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” 
Let go, release the old! For the dimension of Love has drawn near to you. 

Love will gather his precious metals into the machine; but Love will burn up the scrap with unquenchable fire. 

And having been baptized by John, behold! A voice out of the heavens, saying, 
“This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I was well pleased.” 

After hearing John had been arrested, Jesus withdrew into the city of Galilee. 
From that time Jesus began to proclaim and to say, 
“Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near!” 
Let go, release the old! For the dimension of Love has drawn near to you. The dimension of Love is within your midst! 

Much later, Jesus sent out his disciples, instructing them to go out and proclaiming to others this message, 
‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near!’ 
The dimension of Love has drawn near to us now right here near this moment!  

# Love Freely

Freely you received Love, now freely give Love! This is Love! 

# Love's Call 

“Come follow after Love, and Love will make you hunters of men.”

# Love Beatitudes 

For we mourn for Love and Love comforts us! For we are open to mourning, and in being open, we receive Love's comfort! 
We are meek and we inherit Love! In our way of gentleness and ease and service, we receive Love back upon ourselves! 
We are hungering and thirsting for righteousness and we are filled! 
We are merciful and we receive mercy! 
We are pure in heart and from our pure heart's vision we can see God! 
We are peacemakers and peacemakers are the sons of God! 
We are persecuted on account of righteousness, and ours is the kingdom of the heavens! 

# Love's Commands 

Do not think that Love has come to destroy the laws of goodness, for the laws of goodness are in the heart of Love. 
Love has not come to destroy them, but to fulfill the way of the laws in fullness! 
These are the 10 commandments of Moses, and the one who keeps and teaches them, he will be called great in the greater dimension. 

Unless your righteousness is above the dead preachers who obey the commandments not for love, but only to obey law, you will never find the dimension of Love! 

The 'do not's' of the Commandments are very far away from the ways of Love, one following the ways of Love would not do what Love does not do. 

# Love Giving 

If he takes your right cheek, give him your left cheek too! Love gives more than is asked to show Love. This is Love! 
To one willing to sue you and to take your tunic, give him your cloak too. Offer him all that you have in the name of Love. This is Love! 
If he asks you to go a mile with him, go with him two miles! Go with him to show him Love! This is Love! 
Give to who asks you to give, and don't turn away from who asks to borrow from you. This is Love! 

Love your enemies and pray for those persecuting you, so that you may be sons of the Father of Love in the greater dimension.

If you love your friends who love you, and pray for your friends, this is only mutual, as even monsters love their friends, it is natural to want to return gifts to those who give you gifts! From these acts you only return what is given, you gain nothing! 

Love your enemies who do not love you, pray for those who are not your friends. This is Love! 

This is the giving of Love that is the secret to how you can receive more Love and access this dimension.  
This is how you create more of what you desire to receive. 


It is not who loves you that require love.
It is those who do not have love that require love. 
Love loves those who do not have Love. 
Love's heart is for those who do not have Love, who are not being loved. 

In being a servant of Love, you will be perfect in your giving of Love, and in being love 
as your Father in the dimension of Love is perfect, in His giving of Love, in his being love.
This is to say that who is being in Love becomes a being of Love! 

# Knowing Love 

Not everyone saying to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the dimension of Love, 
only the person doing the will of My Father of Love in the dimension of Love enters.

Many will say to Me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ 
And then I will declare unto them, ‘I never knew you; depart you from Me, you workers of lawlessness!’

The laws [principles] say give and you will receive, give love and you will receive love, but the lawless have not given, 
and having not given they will not receive. 
You did many things in My Name, 
but you did not know My Name, for my name was Love, and you said 'Lord', but you did not know Me, had you known Me, you 
would have known the laws [principles] I operate by, you would have known my heart and I would have known you. 
You did many works using My Name, but you thought I was someone else, and you did not understand that I am the servant of my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father. If you knew my Father, you would know me. I have told you who I am and I have told you who my Father is. Why do you think I am other than what I tell you I am? 
I have shown you myself by my way and by my truth by and my life. How could you not know me? 

I am the way. "I am the door." "I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I’m known by my own; 
just in the same way as the Father knows me, and I know the Father." 
My father knows me by Love, and I know the Father by Love, 
and I know my own by Love, and my own know me by Love. 
If you do not know me by my Love, that I am my Love, you still do not know who I am! 

“I told you, and you don’t believe." 
The works that I do in my Father’s name, these testify about me." 
These are the testaments to who I am. If you knew me you would know me by my works. 
My works are how you know me by. 

"But you don’t believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. 
I give eternal life to them. 
They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. 
My Father who has given them to me is greater than all. 
No one is able to snatch them out of my Father’s hand. 
I and the Father are one.”

# Love's Principle 

These are principles. 
Open your heart to gift others with Love's forgiveness, and then keep the door to Love's forgiveness open in your heart, so that you can also receive that same forgiveness through that same doorway. 
If you open the doorway to judgement of others, that very same judgement will come through that same doorway back upon yourself, to the amount that you judged, the same amount of judgement comes back upon you. 

For All things, for All things, for All things, as many things as you might desire,
as many things as you desire, all that you desire for men to give to you, give this to them and you will have gained your desire! 
What you have given, you have already received. 
This is the law for All things! 

# Love's Account 

Love sends you out as sheep into the midst of wolves, so be mindful, and beware of men, because men will take you to court and come against you in their churches. You will be brought before governers and kings on account of Love, 
and you, by remaining steadfast in the way of Love as a representative of Love, you are the testimony of Love to them.
Do not have anxiety about what you will say on account of Love when the time comes, at that time you will be given the words you should say, as it will not be your voice speaking, but the Spirit of Your Father, Love will speak through you. 

This is because you are the example of Love to them, and you are teaching them about Love. You are there as the representative to Love. 

And brothers will sentence their own brothers to death, 
and fathers will sentence their own child to death, 
and children will rise against their own parents and sentence them to death.   
Men will sentence you to death for representing Love. 

Man attacks all things that are in darkness, all things that are hidden. Love is in darkness, and when you expose Love to the world, man will attack you and sentence you to death. 

You will be hated by all on account of the name of Love, but the one who has endured and held onto love to the end, he has been saved. 

Whenever they persecute you in one city, flee to the next, keep going and representing Love for as long as you live. This is Love. 


# Love's Sword

Do not think that Love brings peace to the earth;
Love does not bring peace, it brings a sword. 
It divides those who are of Love from those who are not. 

Love comes to set at odds,  
‘A man against his father, 
and the enemies of the man are his own household.’  

This is not a division between men on opposite sides of borders! 
This is a division between man's 'illusion in his separation', and Love. Love has no borders. 


# Love's Confession 

Everyone who will testify in Love before men, Love will also testify in him to My Father in the dimension of Love.
Whoever denies Love before men, Love will deny him to My Father in the dimension of Love.

Everyone who will testify in Me before men,
confess in the truth of love and my truth that I am love, 
I will also confess to them before my Father in the dimension of Love. 


# Loving Love 

One who cares about his father or mother more than he cares about Love is not worthy of Love. 
One who loves his son or daughter more than Love is not worthy of Love. 
And one who does not surrender his life and follow after Love is not worthy of Love. 
The one having found his life will lose it, and the one who loses his life on account of Love will find it. 

One who receives you receives Me, 
and one who receives Me receives the One who sent Me. 
One who receives you receives Love, 
and one who receives Love receives the One who sent Love. 

One who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive the reward of a prophet. 
One who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive the reward of a righteous man. 
One who receives a man of love in the name of Love will receive Love's reward. 
One who receives a man of God in the name of God will receive God's reward. 

And whoever gives to the children only a cup of cold water because he is My disciple, 
truly I say to you, he will never lose his reward.” 

# Love's Call

Truly I say to you, among those born from women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist. 
Yet the least in the dimension of Love is greater than him!  
And from the days of John the Baptist until now, 
the dimension of Love has been taken by violence and the violent have seized it when it has appeared, 
murdering men who represent Love and, in doing so, receiving Love from the men who were slain. 

All the prophets and the law prophesied until John. 
If you are willing to receive this, John is Elijah, the one being about to come. 

The one having ears, let him hear!

They people say many things and tell us who we are, saying, "He has a demon!" and, "He is a drunkard!" 
They can say whatever they like. 
But wisdom is justified by her deeds. 
We are justified by our deeds as we operate in wisdom. 
We, servants of Love, are servants of wisdom, and we are justified of her deeds. 
That is how we know ourselves as who we are. 

# Love's Hidden Ways Revealed

Although I might wish all things were revealed to this world, I choose to  
“praise You, Father, Lord of the heaven and the earth, that You did have hidden these [Wisdoms, revelations and ways of Love] from the wise and educated, and did reveal these instead to the little children. Yes, Father, for this was well-pleasing before You." 

Come into Love and into Me, all those struggling and burdened, and I will give you rest. 
Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for Love and I are gentle and humble in heart, 
and you will find rest for your souls. For the yoke of Love is easy and the burden of Love is light.”
