What I hear in the darkness, I speak in the light, 
what I hear in my ear, I express!

# About this Work 

This work is as it is. This work may be copied but this line should be intact redirecting to the original source material at [The Gospel of Love 2](https://github.com/motibytes/The-Gospel-of-Love-2).

This work significantly adds to the words of Christ and the Gospel of Matthew and portrays a fundamentally different portrait of the philosophy of the Christ than what is taught in Christology. 
The author is unsure of any eternal consequences for putting words into the mouth of Christ. 

This interpretation is how the author envisions the hidden understanding of the poets and lovers. 

This work should be considered, at worst, as containing abstract spiritual principles and targets the scriptures the church avoids and does not often teach on. 

This work should be considered, at best, an expression of art and love, 
and as food for spiritual contemplation. 

# Preface - The Subject in Question 

This force which must be experienced, this is a force on the other side of the veil of reality.
It is underneath the illusion and is seen when the illusion breaks. 
The disconnection and isolation you feel between yourself and others around you is the illusion you are within. 

One can only be shown love by another. The author believes that, not unlike the princess stories for children, 
only an act of true love can break the sleeping spell. This act is an act of kindness that warms a heart of stone 
so strikingly that the illusion can no longer remain, a sword is cut into the fabric of reality and the underlying 
substance, underneath that fabric, rushes in to fill the space. 

The author's experience is, the act in question is more likely to be effective if it demonstrates that which is truly 
absurd for another being to offer, that which strikingly puts the giver of a gift in a place of vulnerability, 
especially by means of breaking social barriers and risking embarrassment. 
This is to say, to put one's heart out there in a way that no ordinary person would, for no selfish reason. 

This is similar to the way we share romantic love, in which we offer our hearts to one another, 
risking rejection in order to connect. This romantic love however, while it may demonstrate *a love*, 
the intentions behind it, which is akin to a bargain that fulfills needs of both parties, this is not the 
true love that breaks the sleeping spell. 

The love shared in family and friendship in the author's opinion is also not the true love that breaks the sleeping spell.

The elusive true love's kiss, in the author's experience, is the act of loving kindness that has no deeper motivation or 
agenda behind it, it is not dependent even on whether the subject is one that the giver fancies or not. That is, the act has nothing 
to do with the subject's person or the giver's person, it is an act of true love for it is an act to Love, for Love. 
Blessed are we when we receive a love from another when our person seemingly had no qualification to deserve it! 

The author usually uses this example at this time to express the kind of love being discussed. The author's perspective 
is that if the "given" recognizes the act, then the vision of both parties is opened and they are both able to experience 
the force that is there and not dependent on either of them, from an artistic viewpoint, the eyes of one has seen the eyes of 
the other and this has caused a portal to become opened. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, the eye must be opened to this beauty. 

The model painted here is actually that we would all be experiencing this force at all times if we were not casting our own veil of ignorance over ourselves in order to defend ourselves from the threat of pain, that it is we who choose to believe we are alone in order to not risk the vulnerability of getting hurt in connection by a temporary rejection of other. 

The concept, "there is no power to hurt" means that the real you cannot be rejected nor hurt, that when someone hurts you, so to say 
you are bearing witness to two characters that cannot currently see that they are not what they imagine themselves to be. 
This would mean that the actual place you reside in is within the place of this force being discussed. While this goes beyond the 
scope of this introduction it adds to the model. 

This force can only be experienced and is easily seen when an act is demonstrated that shows the receiver that another 
being sees their humanity and cares for them, 
this seems to be an act that looks past the fictional self the receiver believed they were, 
and allows them to see that the target of the gift is their underlying being, 
the human worthy of love in their very existence, 
that is to say, the being that has fundamental human rights and value. 

The giver usually requires one to gift them Love first before being able to give Love. 
This is aligned with the concept, 'The only way to repay one who gives you Love is to give Love to who does not yet have it.'  

# Love's Blessing

Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you, and falsely say all kinds of evil against you because of Love. 

# Love's Draw 

Draw near to Love and Love will draw near to you! 

# Love's Draw 

“Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.” 
Let go, release the old! For the dimension of Love has drawn near to you. 

Love will gather his precious metals into the machine; but Love will burn up the scrap with unquenchable fire. 

And having been baptized by John, behold! A voice out of the heavens, saying, 
“This is my Son, the beloved, in whom I was well pleased.” 

After hearing John had been arrested, Jesus withdrew into the city of Galilee. 
From that time Jesus began to proclaim and to say, 
“Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near!” 
Let go, release the old! For the dimension of Love has drawn near to you. The dimension of Love is within your midst! 

Much later, Jesus sent out his disciples, instructing them to go out and proclaiming to others this message, 
‘The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near!’ 
The dimension of Love has drawn near to us now right here near this moment!  

# Love Freely

Freely you received Love, now freely give Love! This is Love! 

# Love's Call 

“Come follow after Love, and Love will make you hunters of men.”

# Love Beatitudes 

For we mourn for Love and Love comforts us! For we are open to mourning, and in being open, we receive Love's comfort! 
We are meek and we inherit Love! In our way of gentleness and ease and service, we receive Love back upon ourselves! 
We are hungering and thirsting for righteousness and we are filled! 
We are merciful and we receive mercy! 
We are pure in heart and from our pure heart's vision we can see God! 
We are peacemakers and peacemakers are the sons of God! 
We are persecuted on account of righteousness, and ours is the kingdom of the heavens! 

# Love's Commands 

Do not think that Love has come to destroy the laws of goodness, for the laws of goodness are in the heart of Love. 
Love has not come to destroy them, but to fulfill the way of the laws in fullness! 
These are the 10 commandments of Moses, and the one who keeps and teaches them, he will be called great in the greater dimension. 

Unless your righteousness is above the dead preachers who obey the commandments not for love, but only to obey law, you will never find the dimension of Love! 

The 'do not's' of the Commandments are very far away from the ways of Love, one following the ways of Love would not do what Love does not do. 

# Love Giving 

If he takes your right cheek, give him your left cheek too! Love gives more than is asked to show Love. This is Love! 
To one willing to sue you and to take your tunic, give him your cloak too. Offer him all that you have in the name of Love. This is Love! 
If he asks you to go a mile with him, go with him two miles! Go with him to show him Love! This is Love! 
Give to who asks you to give, and don't turn away from who asks to borrow from you. This is Love! 

Love your enemies and pray for those persecuting you, so that you may be sons of the Father of Love in the greater dimension.

If you love your friends who love you, and pray for your friends, this is only mutual, as even monsters love their friends, it is natural to want to return gifts to those who give you gifts! From these acts you only return what is given, you gain nothing! 

Love your enemies who do not love you, pray for those who are not your friends. This is Love! 

This is the giving of Love that is the secret to how you can receive more Love and access this dimension.  
This is how you create more of what you desire to receive. 


It is not who loves you that require love.
It is those who do not have love that require love. 
Love loves those who do not have Love. 
Love's heart is for those who do not have Love, who are not being loved. 

In being a servant of Love, you will be perfect in your giving of Love, and in being love 
as your Father in the dimension of Love is perfect, in His giving of Love, in his being love.
This is to say that who is being in Love becomes a being of Love! 

# Knowing Love 

Not everyone saying to Me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter into the dimension of Love, 
only the person doing the will of My Father of Love in the dimension of Love enters.

Many will say to Me, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name, and in Your name cast out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ 
And then I will declare unto them, ‘I never knew you; depart you from Me, you workers of lawlessness!’

The principles state; give and you will receive, give love and you will receive love; but the lawless have not given, 
and having not given they will not receive. 

You did many things in My Name, 
but you did not know My Name, for my name was Love, and you said 'Lord', but you did not know Me, had you known Me, you 
would have known the principles I operate by, you would have known my heart and I would have known you. 
You did many works using My Name, but you thought I was someone else, and you did not understand that I am the servant of my Father. If you knew me, you would know my Father. If you knew my Father, you would know me. I have told you who I am and I have told you who my Father is. Why do you think I am other than what I tell you I am? 
I have shown you myself by my way and by my truth by and my life. How could you not know me? 

I am the way. "I am the door." "I am the good shepherd. I know my own, and I’m known by my own; 
just in the same way as the Father knows me, and I know the Father." 
My father knows me by Love, and I know the Father by Love, 
and I know my own by Love, and my own know me by Love. 
If you do not know me by my Love, **that I am my Love**, you still do not know who I am! 

“I told you, and you don’t believe." 
The works that I do in my Father’s name, these testify about me." 
These are the testaments to who I am. If you knew me you would know me by my works, you would know my love. 
My works are how you know me by. My works are my expression of my love, of me. 

"But you don’t believe, because you are not of my sheep, as I told you.
My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me. 
I give eternal life to them. 
They will never perish, and no one will snatch them out of my hand. 
My Father who has given them to me is greater than all. 
No one is able to snatch them out of my Father’s hand. 
I and the Father are one.”

# Love's Principle 

These are principles. 
Open your heart to gift others with Love's forgiveness, and then keep the door to Love's forgiveness open in your heart, so that you can also receive that same forgiveness through that same doorway. 
If you open the doorway to judgement of others, that very same judgement will come through that same doorway back upon yourself, to the amount that you judged, the same amount of judgement comes back upon you. 

For All things, for All things, for All things, as many things as you might desire,
as many things as you desire, all that you desire for men to give to you, give this to them and you will have gained your desire! 
What you have given, you have already received. 
This is the law for All things! 

# Love's Account 

Love sends you out as sheep into the midst of wolves, so be mindful, and beware of men, because men will take you to court and come against you in their churches. You will be brought before governers and kings on account of Love, 
and you, by remaining steadfast in the way of Love as a representative of Love, you are the testimony of Love to them.
Do not have anxiety about what you will say on account of Love when the time comes, at that time you will be given the words you should say, as it will not be your voice speaking, but the Spirit of Your Father, Love will speak through you. 

This is because you are the example of Love to them, and you are teaching them about Love. You are there as the representative to Love. 

And brothers will sentence their own brothers to death, 
and fathers will sentence their own child to death, 
and children will rise against their own parents and sentence them to death.   
Men will sentence you to death for representing Love. 

Man attacks all things that are in darkness, all things that are hidden. Love is in darkness, and when you expose Love to the world, man will attack you and sentence you to death. 

You will be hated by all on account of the name of Love, but the one who has endured and held onto love to the end, he has been saved. 

Whenever they persecute you in one city, flee to the next, keep going and representing Love for as long as you live. This is Love. 


# Love's Sword

Do not think that Love brings peace to the earth;
Love does not bring peace, it brings a sword. 
It divides those who are of Love from those who are not. 

Love comes to set at odds,  
‘A man against his father, 
and the enemies of the man are his own household.’  

This is not a division between men on opposite sides of borders! 
This is a division between man's 'illusion in his separation', and Love. Love has no borders. 


# Love's Confession 

Everyone who will testify in Love before men, Love will also testify in him to My Father in the dimension of Love.
Whoever denies Love before men, Love will deny him to My Father in the dimension of Love.

Everyone who will testify in Me before men,
confess in the truth of love and my truth that I am love, 
I will also confess to them before my Father in the dimension of Love. 


# Loving Love 

One who cares about his father or mother more than he cares about Love is not worthy of Love. 
One who loves his son or daughter more than Love is not worthy of Love. 
And one who does not surrender his life and follow after Love is not worthy of Love. 
The one having found his life will lose it, and the one who loses his life on account of Love will find it. 

One who receives you receives Me, 
and one who receives Me receives the One who sent Me. 
One who receives you receives Love, 
and one who receives Love receives the One who sent Love. 

One who receives a prophet in the name of a prophet will receive the reward of a prophet. 
One who receives a righteous man in the name of a righteous man will receive the reward of a righteous man. 
One who receives a man of love in the name of Love will receive Love's reward. 
One who receives a man of God in the name of God will receive God's reward. 

And whoever gives to the children only a cup of cold water because he is My disciple, 
truly I say to you, he will never lose his reward.” 

# Love's Call

Truly I say to you, among those born from women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist. 
Yet the least in the dimension of Love is greater than him!  
And from the days of John the Baptist until now, 
the dimension of Love has been taken by violence and the violent have seized it when it has appeared, 
murdering men who represent Love and, in doing so, receiving Love from the men who were slain. 

All the prophets and the law prophesied until John. 
If you are willing to receive this, John is Elijah, the one being about to come. 

The one having ears, let him hear!

They people say many things and tell us who we are, saying, "He has a demon!" and, "He is a drunkard!" 
They can say whatever they like. 
But wisdom is justified by her deeds. 
We are justified by our deeds as we operate in wisdom. 
We, servants of Love, are servants of wisdom, and we are justified of her deeds. 
That is how we know ourselves as who we are. 

# Love's Hidden Ways Revealed

Although I might wish all things were revealed to this world, I choose to  
“praise You, Father, Lord of the heaven and the earth, that You did have hidden these [Wisdoms, revelations and ways of Love] from the wise and educated, and did reveal these instead to the little children. Yes, Father, for this was well-pleasing before You." 

Come into Love and into Me, all those struggling and burdened, and I will give you rest. 
Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, as Love and I are gentle and humble in heart, 
and you will find rest for your souls. The yoke of Love is easy and the burden of Love is light.” 


# Love's Unlawfulness 

If you had known what this meant, ‘I desire mercy and not sacrifice,’ 
then you would have known Love, and if you had known Love, then you would not have condemned the guiltless.

# Love's Value 

[It was illegal to 'work' on the day of rest and man would condemn you for doing any 'acts of work' on this day.] 

“Which among you, if you own one sheep, and the sheep falls into a pit on the day of rest, will not rescue the sheep?
How much more valuable therefore is a man than a sheep! It is lawful to do good on the day of rest.” 

It is lawful to serve good above law. 

#  Love's Servant 

“Behold My servant,

whom I have chosen,

My beloved,

in whom My soul has found delight.

I will put My Spirit upon Him,

and He will proclaim justice to the non-Jews.

He will not quarrel nor will he cry out;

nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.

A bruised reed He will not break,

and a smoldering wick He will not quench,

until He leads justice to victory.

And in His name the non-Jews will hope.”


# Love's Being

And the priests having heard Christs' words said, “This man casts out the demons only by Beelzebul, the prince of the demons.”

Knowing they were thinking this, he said to them, 
“Every kingdom that has been divided against itself falls apart, 
and every city or home that is divided against itself will not stand. 

If Satan casts out Satan, then he is divided against himself. 
So how will his kingdom stand?

And if I cast out demons through the powers of Beelzebul, 
then by who do your sons cast them out? 
Your sons would judge you for saying this. 

But if I cast out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.

"Or how is anyone able to enter into the house of the strong man, 
and to rob his goods, 
unless he first takes down and binds up the strong man? 
Only after he takes him down will he rob his goods."

If I were not with the Spirit of God, I could not enter the house of God and take the Spirit of God's powers, 
not unless I first overcame the Spirit of God himself. 

"He who is not with Me is against Me, and he who is not gathering with Me, scatters."

"The one not being with Me is against Me, and the one not gathering with Me scatters."

I am the one being with the Spirit of God, and the one who is not with me is not with the Spirit of God. 
You are not with me because you are divided against me. If you were not divided against me, you might be with me! 

This is just like how the one not being with Love is against Love, and the one not gathering in Love, scatters. 
This is because Love is of a gathering, and not being of Love is being of a dividing. 

You cannot divide and be in Love, because Love is not division. 

If you are divided, you are on the opposing kingdom apart from Love, 
and being in the divided kingdom, your kingdom too is divided and scatters until it falls apart. 

If one were being with Me, and I am being with the Kingdom of the Spirit of God, 
then he would be being in the Kingdom of the Spirit of God as well. 

# Love's Justification

"By your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned.” 

The words you say out loud are remembered by yourself and others, and these words become the testimony of you. 
The words you have said can either justify you or condemn you based on the words. 
If you speak words of love you would be justified by your words, 
If you spoke words of hate you would be condemned by your words. 

If your words justified others, those same words would justify you. 
If your words condemned others, those same words would condemn you. 

A man who condemns everyone else, who will come to defend him? 

A righteous man speaks righteous words and he is known by his words, 
and people testify that he is righteous because of the righteous words they have heard him saying. 

When the finger is pointed at this righteous man, 
people will come to defend him on account of his words.
people will come to justify him, just as he justified them. 


# Love's Wisdom and Wealth

A materialistic generation wants to see a sign from the Teacher, and I will give them no sign. 

The queen of the south will rise up in judgment with this generation and will condemn it for this. 
She came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, a greater wisdom than Solomon is here.

[
From the older scriptures: 
When the queen of Sheba saw all the wisdom of Solomon and the palace he had built,
she said, 
"I did not believe these things until I came and saw them with my own eyes. 
Indeed, not even half of this was told to me;
in wisdom and wealth you have far exceeded what I had heard." 

How happy your people must be! 
How happy your officials must be, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! 

Praise be to the LORD your God, who has delighted in you and placed you on the throne of Israel. 
Because of the LORD’s eternal love for Israel, he has made you king to maintain justice and righteousness.” 
]

# Love's Mother and Brothers

While He was speaking to the crowds, 
his mother and brothers were standing outside, 
seeking to speak to Him.  
Then someone said to Him, “Behold, Your mother and Your brothers are standing outside, they seek to speak to You.”
He answered to the one telling Him, “Who is My mother, and who are My brothers?” 

He stretched out His hand to His disciples and said, “Behold, these are My mother and My brothers. 
Whoever will do the will of My Father in the dimension of Love is My brother and my sister and my mother.”

Those who do the will of love are my own. My brother is love. My mother is love. My sister is love. 
He that does the will of love is love, he is My brother and sister and mother! 

# Love's Blessing 

His disciples asked Him, "“Why do You speak to them in parables?” 

He said to them, “Because it has been granted to you to know the mysteries of the dimension of Love, 
but to them it has not been granted. 

Anyone who has, to him will be given, and he will be in abundance. 
Anyone who does not have, even what he has will be taken away from him."

They do not have understanding, so I cannot give more of the understanding that I have to them, I can only give them parables. 

"Because of this I speak to them in parables:

‘Because from seeing, they do not see,

and from hearing they do not hear, neither do they understand.’"

Their sight blinds them. Their hearing deafens them. Their understanding gives them misunderstanding.

"And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah, saying:

‘In hearing you will hear and never understand;

and in seeing you will see and never perceive.

The heart of this people has dulled,

and they barely hear with the ears,

and they have closed their eyes,

but in the case they can see with the eyes,

then they should hear with the ears,

then they should understand with the heart,

and should turn,

and I will heal them.’ 

But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. 
Truly I tell you that many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see, and they did not see; 
and longed to hear what you hear, and they did not hear.

For you have understood with your heart! 
And in your heart this understanding has healed you! 
See through your Heart.
Listen through your heart, 

Stop seeing with your eyes. 
Stop hearing with your ears. 
Begin seeing with your heart. 
Begin listening with your heart. 
Begin understanding. 

Every time you begin thinking with your mind, 
you stop listening. 
Every time you think you have understanding in your thoughts, 
you are not listening with your heart. 
Everything you have ever been told about religion and scripture you have heard in your mind! Throw these false ideas away!
Silence your thoughts and allow your heart to understand these words, by allowing your heart to feel them. 

As the modern Christians say, listen through your Holy Spirit. 

# Love's Hidden Truth 

“I will open My mouth in parables;

I will utter things hidden from the foundation of the world.”

# Love's Reception

The disciples came to Jesus, saying, “Who then is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens?”

He summoned a child and set it in their midst, and said, 
“Truly I say to you, 
if you are not converted and become as the little children, 
you will never enter into the kingdom of the heavens. 

So whoever humbles himself like this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of the heavens. 
And whoever will receive one such little child in My name, receives Me.

If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in Me to stumble, 
it would be better for him to have a large millstone hung around his neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea."



# Love Seeks the One 

What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them goes astray, 
will he not leave the ninety-nine on the hills and go out to search for the one that has gone astray?

And if he finds it, truly I tell you, he rejoices more over that one sheep than over the ninety-nine that did not go astray.

So it is not the will of your Father in the heavens that any one of these little ones should perish.
Love's will is to help not the many, but the one. 
Love always knows it is the **one** who needs Love, the one is who Love calls out to, the one is who calls out for Love. 
Love's victory and success and celebration is in saving the one. 
It is not the will of Love for any single one to perish.



# Love's Agreement 

Love is in agreement. 

Again truly I say to you that if two of you on the earth might agree concerning any matter that they shall ask, 
it will be done for them by My Father in the dimension of Love.

Where two or three are gathered together in My name, there I am in their midst."

Where two or three are gathered together in Love, there is Love in their midst. 

Love is in agreement. 

# Love's Master 

His master called his servant saying, ‘Evil servant, I forgave you of all that debt because you begged me. 
Shouldn't you have pitied your fellow servant, as I also had pitied you?’ 

Angered, his master delivered him to the jailers, until he paid all that he owed. 

This is also what My Heavenly Father will do to you, unless each of you forgives your brother from your heart.”

Love forgives debts. 

If you do not forgive in Love, 
how will you be forgiven through Love? 

Only love can forgive. 

If you do not forgive your brother from your heart through love, 
your heart cannot have forgiveness of yourself through love either. 

You must give forgiveness in your heart to receive forgiveness in your heart. 

You can only give what you know how to give, 
but because you have already been forgiven by Love, 
for forgiveness is in Love's very nature, 

you can receive the forgiveness in your heart from Love in the understanding that it has forgiven you, 
and you can give that forgiveness to your brother. 

Do not understand this with your mind. 
Do not listen to this with your mind. 


# Love's Perfection

A young man asked, “Teacher, what good thing shall I do that I might have eternal life?”
And He said to him, “Why do you ask Me about what is good? Only One is good. 
But if you desire to enter into life, keep the commandments.” 

He asked Him, “Which?”
And Jesus said, “‘You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness, you shall honor the father and mother, and you shall love your neighbor as yourself.’” 

The young man replied, “All these things I have kept. What do I still lack?” 

Jesus was saying to him, “If you desire to be perfect, go, sell your possessions, and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in the heavens; 
and come, follow Me.” 

When he heard this, the young man went away grieving; as he owned many possessions.



# Love's Followers 

Jesus said to His disciples, “Truly I say to you that it will be difficult for a rich man to enter into the dimension of Love. 
And again I say to you, 
it is easier for a camel to go through a needle's eye, than it is for a rich man to enter into the dimension of Love.”

The disciples were exceedingly astonished and were asking, “Who then is able to be saved?”

And Jesus looked and said to them,
“With men, this is impossible, but with God, all things are possible.”

Then Peter answering said to Him, 
“Behold, we left all things and followed You; what will become of us?” 

And Jesus said to them, “Truly I say to you that in the regeneration, 
when the Son of Man shall sit down upon His throne of glory, 
you having followed Me, 
you also will sit on twelve thrones, 
judging the twelve tribes of Israel. 

And everyone who has left houses, 
or brothers, or sisters, 
or father, or mother, 
or wife, or children, 
or lands, for the sake of My name, the name of Love, 
will receive a hundredfold, 
and will inherit eternal life. 

But many who are first - the high - will be last, and the last - the low - will be first. 


# Love's Authority 

While He was teaching in the temple, the chief priests and elders came to Him and asked, “By what authority are You doing these things? And who gave to You this authority?”

And Jesus answering, said to them, 
“I will ask you one thing, and if you tell Me, I will tell you by what authority I do these things. 
From where was the baptism of John? From heaven, or from men?”

They were reasoning amongst themselves saying, “If we say, ‘from heaven,’ 
He will say to us, 
‘Why then did you not believe John?’ But if we say, ‘from men,’ we fear the masses; 
as all hold John to be a prophet.” 

They answered Jesus, “We do not know.”

And He said to them, 
“Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things." 


# Love Has Already Come 

“Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the prostitutes go before you into the dimension of Love. 

John came to you in the way of righteousness, 
and you did not believe him, 
but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him;
And yet you saw this and did not even repent afterwards to believe him." 

# Love's Marvel 

Jesus says to them, “Did you never read in the Scriptures: 

‘The stone that those building rejected,

this has become the chief corner.

This was from the Lord,

and it is marvelous in our eyes’?

Because of this I say to you that the the Kingdom of God - the dimension of Love - will be taken away from you, and will be given to a people producing its fruits. 
And the one who falls onto this stone will be broken; 
but on whoever this stone falls upon, 
the stone will grind him into powder.” 

He who has an ear let him hear! 
Love is the asset which the world does not want and throws away in front of man's other priorities. 
He ignores that Love was called for and instead acts from his mind. 
The Church upholds mental idealism and discards Love.

This world - including the church - obeys the instructions given in the scriptures, 
but the world obeys the instructions from the mind and not the heart, 
the world obeys the scriptures without the heart of Love.

They do acts of obedience without compassion, without wisdom, without understanding.
Without these ways of goodness, the Kingdom of God is instead given to those who follow a greater Love.  

Falling on Love will break a man, 
but if Love falls upon a man, 
he will be destroyed! 

Falling on Spirit will also break a man, 
but if Spirit falls upon a man, 
he will be destroyed! 

The Spirit is also taken away from the church and given to those who are operating within the domain of the dimension of Love, those who are operating within Righteousness, Peace, and Joy, and the other ways of Goodness and Wisdom. 

# Love's Greatest Law

A lawyer questioned Him to test Him, asking, “Teacher, which commandment is the greatest in the Law?”

And He said to the lawyer, 
“‘You shall Love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind.’ 
This is the great and first commandment. And the second is like it: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ 
On these two commandments hang all the Law and the Prophets.”

All the Law and the wise men hang off of Love. 
Love you will Love with your all your Heart. 
Love you will Love with all your Soul. 
Love you will Love with all of your Mind. 

You will Love the another as You. 
Love will Love another as Love. 

You will Love the other as Love.

It is Love that you will Love as Love. 

It is Love that Love will Love as Love. 

The words are clear, it is only the mind and systematic programming that reject the understanding of this highest commandment, this commandment above all commandments. 

This commandment understood in terms of Love causes a problem in all religion because it implies that Love precedes and takes precedence over the concept of God and what the mind believes God is. 

The mind and the 'Lawyer of the mind', 
the part of the mind that creates religion and categorizes the laws of operation, 
this wants to uphold the concept of God, 
the conceptualization of God first, Love second.
 
Love comes first. 

God in our world is a conceptual idea wrapped around Love from a single-pointed, individualized, limited conscious experiencer. 

Love is Love. 

The question asked by the lawyer was a trap set by the Lawyer of the mind 
to confuse Christ, as the lawyer of the mind must categorize laws in linear order, such is law, 
but in Understanding is the Love of Love itself, which was never of the mind. 
The laws exist for the mind to follow in order to not offend the ways of Love. 

It is unfortunate that the mind may not be able to understand Love as a word. 
This is why man proclaims different words to express the Highest God for which he is referring to. 

For the mind then, 
It is Love that will Love as Love, 
It is _ that _ will _ as _. 


# Love's Higher Understanding 

And the Pharisees having been assembled together, 
Jesus questioned them, asking, “What do you think concerning the Christ? Of who is He the son?” 

They say to Him, “Of David.”

He says to them, “How then does David in spirit call Him Lord, saying: 

‘The Lord said to my Lord,

“Sit at My right hand,

until I place Your enemies

as a footstool for Your feet.”’

So if David calls Him Lord, how is He his son?” 

And no one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day to question Him any longer.

While this teaching affirms Jesus to be the Christ, 
it too can be broken down to teach  Love, as Love is both my mother and my father and my daughter and my brother and my neighbor, 
so then the Christ is David's son and His Father. 
Had they listened to Christ's words before, they would have heard the answer to His riddle, as He had already given it many times. 



# Love's Works 

Do not do according to their works, they preach and do not act.  
And they tie up burdens heavy and hard to bear and lay them on the shoulders of men;  
but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger. 

They preach of love and goodness but do not live their lives for Love and Goodness. 
They tell you what you should do, but they themselves would not do these things. 
They ask you of the impossible ways a man ought to live his life, to do what is too much for a man to do, 
and this brings their sheep into submission through guilt and shame at their weakness. 

In telling you what you should do and how you should live, they repress you, control you, 
stop you from Life as they themselves prevent themselves from living. 

They use what you should do to weigh you down and keep you down. 
Do not do according to their works, do not live according to their ways. 

Observe Love! Know Love! Inspect Love! Investigate Love! Dissect Love! Ponder Love! Quantify Love! 
Measure Love by Love's Measure! Do not do according to their works, do according to Love's ways! 

But the greatest among you will be your servant. 
The greatest among you is the servant! 
For this is the servant of Love! 

No single mind has the data or communication necessary to tell you what you must do. 
Love does not tell you to tell others what they should do, 
in Listening to Love you Listen for what Love calls for you to do, 
and this means that to follow Love you cannot live as you are told by others to live, 
and you cannot tell others to live as your mind understands that they should Live, 
because others cannot even hear your advice, not unless God Himself is allowed to speak 
through your voice. 

# Love's Exaltation 

And whoever will exalt himself will be humbled, 
and whoever humble himself will be exalted. This is Love! 

If you rise in pride, you will be brought crashing down into humility. 
If you humble yourself to be nothing, you will gain a pride much greater than anything! 

What you give is what you get! 

Ask and you shall receive! 

These two secrets are the same secret! 

When you give away what you want, you gain what you want! 
If you desire Love, you must give away Love, and you receive it! 
If you have lustful desires, you must give away, relinquish your desires of lust, and then you may receive that which you lusted! 

All desires must be given away in order to be gained. 
This is only one level of Truth to this concept. 

# Love's Gate  

To the religious, you close the kingdom of the heavens to man. 
You neither enter, and you do not even allow those who are entering to go in. 

To the religious, you close the gate to the dimension of Love, in closing the door to Wisdom, 
you do not enter into the dimension of Love, 
and for those who know Love and wish to pursue Love and its deeper Way, 
you have not allowed them access to the wisdom they have come to you for as they are traveling on the Way! 

# Love's Wailing 

Jerusalem, Jerusalem, killing the prophets of Love and stoning those who were of Love that were sent to her! 

How often would I have gathered together your children, 
the way in which a hen gathers together her chicks under the wings, 
and you were not willing! 
Behold, your house is left to you desolate! 
For I say to you, 
you will not see Me from now until you say, 
‘Blessed is the One coming in the name of the Lord.’ 

you will not see Love from now until you say, 
'Blessed is the One coming in the name of the Lord.' 

Perhaps 
You are the Blessed One coming in the name of the Lord, the name of Love! 

Perhaps  
Love is the One that comes in the name of the Lord! 
In other words, the name of the Lord, God, this name is used as a placeholder term to represent Love, the One that comes! 

And in Love we mourn and weep that those servants of Love that Love sent, 
Love's messengers, 
they have been killed and stoned! 



# Love's Name 

“Take heed, lest anyone mislead you. For many will come in My Name, in The name of Love, saying, ‘I am the Christ,’ and they will mislead many."  
Nation will rise up against nation, and kingdoms will rise up against kingdoms, 
and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. And all these are the beginning of birth pains. 

Nations go to war with other nations in His name but they do not operate in the ways of His name, in the Way of Love. Love is one, just as Love is my neighbor and my brother and my sister and Love loves my enemy. 

Those with spiritual understanding can see that Love must go through many birthpains in order to change the heart of humanity and blossom a hardened heart into a beautiful flowering. 
As Love is revealed itself there will be great pain, as the world reacts violently to the exposure of Love and its ways, including the ways of Life. The system will react violently to even music and dancing, song and laughter, happiness and romance, all of these things the world will oppress and try to contain,  
for darkness must grow until the hearts of man are willing to expand and open their hearts. 

Only in the darkest of night can the darkest hearts of mankind see the light. 

"The people living in darkness 
have seen a great light; 
on those living in the land of the shadow of death, 
a light has dawned.” 

He who has an ear let him hear! Love can only break through the heart of man when he is living in the land of the shadow of death! 

Only in great darkness will man see the hidden light! 
Love will only be born after this earth's heart has taken enough destruction for Love to cry out above all voices in the city streets and be heard by the people and her Ways followed. 

All who possess understanding of Love and follow its Way come to know and see these birth pains of humanity.  

# Love's Account 

Then will they deliver you to tribulation, and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations on account of My name, the name of Love.

And then many will fall away, and they will betray eachother, and they will hate eachother; 
and many false prophets, the ones who do not know Love will arise, and will lead many astray. 

They will hate one another as they did not choose love, and they will kill you for love.  
The world will react violently to Love always, because Love causes death to this world. 
Love's Ways are destructive to man's own ways, systems, and structures. 
Man's own ways, systems, and structures are also destructive to himself, and a house divided will fall.

# Love's Endurance

'And because lawlessness willis to be multiplied, the love of the many will grow cold. But the one who has endured to the end, he will be saved.'

The love of the masses will have grown cold, but the one who has held on to Love to the end will be saved by Love for he is Love! 

But for the rest, their love will grow cold. And Love will say to them, I never knew you! Begone from me, you workers of lawlessness! 

Be the one who endures in holding onto Love until the end. 
This is because Love is all that remains in the end. 

# Love's Beginning 

And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed in the whole earth, for a testimony to all the nations; and then the end will come. 

And finally, 
‘The sun will be darkened, 

and the moon will not give its light, 

and the stars will fall from the sky, 

and the powers of the heavens will be shaken.’ 

There will be no light left upon the earth. 

# Love's Nearness

"Now learn the parable of the fig tree: When its branch already may have become tender and it puts forth leaves, you know that the summer is near. So also you, when you see all these things, know that He is near, at the doors."

Look around you and look to see all these things of summer! 
Love has drawn near to us now in the present! 
Open the doors! 

# Love

Then the righteous will answer Him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see You hungering, and fed You? Or thirsting, and gave You drink? And when did we see You a stranger, and took You in? Or naked, and clothed You? And when did we see You ailing or in prison, and came to You?’

And the King answering, will say to them, ‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did it to one of the least of these brothers of Mine, you did it to Me.’ 

You were a servant of Love, and you served Me. 
When I called for you, you gave to me. 
As I have told you, I am your brother and your sister and your mother and your father and your lover. 
I am the stranger and I am the hungry and I am the thirsting, I am the naked, I am the ailing, I am the imprisoned and I am you. 
 
Then also He will say to those on the left, 
‘Depart from Me, those being cursed, into the eternal fire, you have been prepared for the devil and his angels. I hungered, and you gave to Me nothing to eat; 
and I thirsted, and You gave Me nothing to drink; 
I was a stranger, and You did not take Me in; 
naked, and you did not clothe Me; 
sick and in prison, and you did not visit Me.’ 

‘Truly I say to you, to the extent that you did not do it to one of the least of these, neither did you to Me.’
And these will go away into eternal punishment; but the righteous into eternal life.”

And I will say I never knew you, for I told you who I was and you never knew me. 

# Love's Words 

'The heaven and the earth will pass away, but My words shall not pass away.' 

For my words are the words of Love! Love's words will never pass away! 
Love's words cry out on the street corner! 
My words are that which was never born and have never died, 
they are eternal because they are of Truth. 

My words will not pass away because Love's words are inaudible to the one who hears them. 
Those who know Love's words can always hear Love's words. 

To Know Love is to Know Knowing. 
To know Wisdom is to know Wisdom. 
Wisdom is of Love. 
Wisdom is in Life. 
Life and Wisdom are within Love. 

The reason that Love's words can never pass away is because Eternal Life is Eternal Life. 
Life will never pass away for it is Life and it is not Death. 

Death is what passes away. Life Lives Eternally. 

Love's words can never pass away because Life itself carries Wisdom. 
One can learn Wisdom by observing Life. 
The Ways of God and the Ways of Love are all within Life's Way. 
The Way of Love is also the Way of Life. 
Life teaches Love, and it teaches Love silently through the observation of how Life operates 
by those who are capable of understanding. 
Love can be silently learned by observing the growth in Life and man needs no teacher but God Himself to reveal Wisdom's Ways to him. 

Man's world falls farther into darkness as it isolates itself from Life and man's people, 
the ones capable of understanding Love, they are exposed less to Life and live within Death.  

When Death has killed most of Life, man's heart will cry out and break open to destroy Death and return to the Ways of Life, the Ways of Love, the Truth of Life. 

I Am the Way, the Truth, and the Life. 

"He is not the God of the dead, but of the living."
